This repository is a series of data structures and algorithms that I'm implementing with Go.

## Search 🔎

At the moment, contains just binary search.

## Data Structures 🚧

Contains linked list, binary search trees, stack, and queue.

## Sorts 💁

Contains bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, and insertion sort.

## Challenges

Miscellaneous coding challenges.

## Tests

Run `go test ./...` at the root level to run all tests for all packages.

Run `go test` when inside of a package to run tests for that package.
